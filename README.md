## üöÄ Features

* **Intuitive UI:** A simple and straightforward window inside Revit.
* **Schedule Selection:** Automatically loads all project schedules into a dropdown list.
* **Safe Export:** Exports schedule data to an `.xlsx` file, ensuring each object's `ElementID` is included for error-free re-importing.
* **Smart Import:** Reads the Excel file, identifies elements by their `ElementID`, and updates only the modified parameters.
* **Safe Transactions:** All modifications are wrapped in a single Revit transaction, allowing the entire operation to be undone with a single click.

## üì¶ Installation (For Users)

1.  Go to the [**Releases**](https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Revit-Excel-Parameter-Editor/releases) page of this repository.
2.  Download the `.zip` file from the latest version.
3.  Unzip the file. You will find the main items inside:
    * The `RevitParameterEditor.bundle` folder (or the `RevitParameterEditor.dll` and `RevitParameterEditor.addin` files).
